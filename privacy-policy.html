    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 25, 2026</p>

    <p>Witold Dziurdz ("we", "us", or "our") built the <strong>Sparkly - Discover New</strong> app (the "App") as a free, ad-supported application. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our App.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Sparkly does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal information to our servers. All your data (event history, preferences, scheduled events) is stored locally on your device only.</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect and use data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers (IDFA, when you grant permission)</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>General location data</li>
        <li>App usage data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising by declining the App Tracking Transparency prompt or adjusting your device's privacy settings. You may also remove all ads by purchasing the "Remove Ads" in-app purchase.</p>
    <p>For more information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>App Tracking Transparency</h2>
    <p>On iOS 14.5 and later, Sparkly will request your permission before tracking your activity across other companies' apps and websites. If you decline, you will still see ads, but they will not be personalized.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Sparkly offers a "Remove Ads" in-app purchase that permanently removes all ads and supports the developer. This purchase is processed by Apple. We do not collect or have access to your payment information. Please refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a> for details on how Apple handles payment data.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses the following third-party services that may collect information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google AdMob</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple StoreKit</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is rated 12+ and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. The ads shown are configured to comply with applicable regulations.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Since all user data is stored locally on your device, deleting the App will remove all associated data. We retain no data on any servers.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
